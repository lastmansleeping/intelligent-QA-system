33	D40	flat roofs in israel flat roof in los angeles a flat roof is a type of covering for a building in contrast to the more sloped form of roof a flat roof is horizontal or nearly horizontal the slope of a roof is properly known as its pitch roofs which are nearly flat are known as lowpitch roofs as the angle of slope increases so the pitch is said to increase any sheet of material used to cover a flat or lowpitched roof is usually known as a membrane and the primary purpose of these membranes is to waterproof the roof area materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dry gutters on smaller roofs often lead water directly onto the ground or better into a specially made soakaway gutters on larger roofs usually lead water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area occasionally flat roofs though are designed to collect water in a pool usually for aesthetic purposes or for rainwater buffering flat roofs exist all over the world and each area has its own tradition or preference for materials used in warmer climes where rainfall is less and freezing is unlikely to occur many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun and cheap and easy to build where timber is not readily available in areas where the roof could become saturated by rain and leak or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to ice and thus lead to blowing breaking up of the mortarbrickworkconcrete by the expansion of ice as it forms these roofs are not suitable traditionally most flat roofs in the western world make use of tar or more usually tar paper applied over roof decking to keep a building watertight the tar or tarpaper is in turn covered in gravel to keep the suns heat uv rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation roof decking is usually of plywood chipboard or osb boards osb oriented strand board also known as sterling board of around 18mm thickness the tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid heated in a tar kettle or as sheets of tar impregnated paper glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar once it has cooled the gravel is spread evenly over it a main reason for failure of these traditional roofs is ignorance or lack of maintenance where people or events cause the gravel to be moved or removed from the tar or tarpaper waterproofing thus exposing it to weather and sun whereupon cracking and blistering occurs over time and eventually water gets in tarpaper is usually a paper or fibre material soaked or impregnated in tar as gravel cannot protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically from the roof such as on parapet walls or upstands tarpaper variants are produced with fine gravel applied to the hot tar during the process of manufacture such that a permanent layer of gravel is stuck to it in order to give it ongoing protection tarpapers vary in quality as does the workmanship and training of those applying it to produce more or less successful results in some micro climates or shaded areas these rather basic tarpaper roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them however the cost of modern membranes such as epdm has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordable there are now more firms supplying modern alternatives and there is generally a growing awareness of their performance and availability if a leak does occur on a flat roof then damage often goes unnoticed for long periods of time during which water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation andor structure beneath it this can lead to expensive damage from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structure there are also various health risks to people and animals breathing the mould spores the severity of this health risk remains a debated point one problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering be it traditional or a modern membrane it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building where it can be seen thus it is not easy to see where it is leaking in order to repair it once underlying roof decking is soaked it often sags causing a further collection or puddling of water in that area and the problem worsens

37	D44	hurricane isabel 2003 as seen from orbit during expedition 7 of the international space station the eye eyewall and surrounding rainbands characteristics of tropical cyclones are clearly visible in this view from space a tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a lowpressure center surrounded by a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air they are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as noreasters european windstorms and polar lows the characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings a phenomenon called warm core storm systems the term tropical refers both to the geographical origin of these systems which usually form in tropical regions of the globe and to their formation in maritime tropical air masses the term cyclone refers to such storms cyclonic nature with counterclockwise wind flow in the northern hemisphere and clockwise wind flow in the southern hemisphere the opposite direction of the wind flow is a result of the coriolis force depending on its location and strength a tropical cyclone is referred to by names such as hurricane typhoon tropical storm cyclonic storm tropical depression and simply cyclone while tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain they are also able to produce high waves damaging storm surge and tornadoes they develop over large bodies of warm water and lose their strength if they move over land due to increased surface friction and loss of the warm ocean as an energy source this is why coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone while inland regions are relatively safe from receiving strong winds heavy rains however can produce significant flooding inland and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to from the coastline although their effects on human populations can be devastating tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions they also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism as a result tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the earths troposphere and to maintain a relatively stable and warm temperature worldwide many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable the background environment is modulated by climatological cycles and patterns such as the maddenjulian oscillation el niñosouthern oscillation and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere if the conditions remain favorable the tropical disturbance intensifies and can even develop an eye on the other end of the spectrum if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall the system weakens and eventually dissipates it is not possible to artificially induce the dissipation of these systems with current technology

173	D241	prof walter lewin explains newtons law of gravitation in mit course 801 satellites and projectiles all obey newtons law of gravitation newtons law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them separately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers this is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what newton called induction it is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in newtons work philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica the principia first published on 5 july 1687 when newtons book was presented in 1686 to the royal society robert hooke made a claim that newton had obtained the inverse square law from him – see history section below in modern language the law states the following assuming si units f is measured in newtons n m1 and m2 in kilograms kg r in meters m and the constant g is approximately equal to the value of the constant g was first accurately determined from the results of the cavendish experiment conducted by the british scientist henry cavendish in 1798 although cavendish did not himself calculate a numerical value for g this experiment was also the first test of newtons theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory it took place 111 years after the publication of newtons principia and 71 years after newtons death so none of newtons calculations could use the value of g instead he could only calculate a force relative to another force newtons law of gravitation resembles coulombs law of electrical forces which is used to calculate the magnitude of electrical force between two charged bodies both are inversesquare laws in which force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies coulombs law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses and the electrostatic constant in place of the gravitational constant newtons law has since been superseded by einsteins theory of general relativity but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme precision or when dealing with gravitation for extremely massive and dense objects

317	D459	each antibody binds to a specific antigen an interaction similar to a lock and key an antibody ab also known as an immunoglobulin ig is a large yshaped protein produced by bcells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses the antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen each tip of the y of an antibody contains a paratope a structure analogous to a lock that is specific for one particular epitope similarly analogous to a key on an antigen allowing these two structures to bind together with precision using this binding mechanism an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system or can neutralize its target directly for example by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival the production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell antibodies can occur in two physical forms a soluble form that is secreted from the cell and a membrane bound form that is attached to the surface of a b cell and is referred to as the b cell receptor bcr the bcr is only found on the surface of b cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory b cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the b cells can respond faster upon future exposure in most cases interaction of the b cell with a t helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the b cell and therefore antibody generation following antigen binding soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains there are several different types of antibody heavy chains and several different kinds of antibodies which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals which perform different roles and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures or antigen binding sites to exist this region is known as the hypervariable region each of these variants can bind to a different antigen this enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens the large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites or paratopes followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene which create further diversity antibody genes also reorganize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region this allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system

320	D462	nanotechnology sometimes shortened to nanotech is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale the earliest widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology a more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the national nanotechnology initiative which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers this definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantumrealm scale and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold it is therefore common to see the plural form nanotechnologies as well as nanoscale technologies to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size because of the variety of potential applications including industrial and military governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research through its national nanotechnology initiative the usa has invested 37 billion dollars the european union has invested 12 billion and japan 750 million dollars nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad including fields of science as diverse as surface science organic chemistry molecular biology semiconductor physics microfabrication etc the associated research and applications are equally diverse ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular selfassembly from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications such as in medicine electronics biomaterials and energy production on the other hand nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials and their potential effects on global economics as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios these concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted

343	D490	events involving meiosis showing chromosomal crossover meiosis is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes the cells produced by meiosis are gametes or spores in many organisms including all animals and land plants but not some other groups such as fungi gametes are called sperm and egg cells whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the lifecycle cell division process of mitosis it differs in two important respects the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different genetic combination in each gamete compared with the coexistence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome one received from each parent in each cell which results from mitosis the outcome of meiosis is potentially four genetically unique haploid cells compared with the two genetically identical diploid cells produced from mitosis meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome —one from the organisms mother and one from its father the cell divides twice potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome potentially because in some cases such as the formation of oocytes in mammals only one of the possible four haploid cells survives in animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal dna resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent this gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations this genetic diversity can provide the variation of physical and behavioural attributes phenotypes upon which natural selection can act but as described below in section 6 origin and function of meiosis the genetic diversity may be largely a byproduct of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its dna repair function during meiosis it is also noteworthy that during meiosis specific genes are more highly transcribed and these are called the meiome the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing synapse and recombination occur in addition to strong meiotic stagespecific expression of mrna the meiome however there are also pervasive translational controls eg selective usage of preformed mrna regulating the ultimate meiotic stagespecific protein expression of genes during meiosis thus both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosis prior to the meiosis process the cells chromosomes are duplicated by a round of dna replication creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome homologs two exact copies sister chromatids attached at the centromere region in the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each other then they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination leading to crossovers of dna between the maternal and paternal versions of the chromosome spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator then the fibers pull the recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cell as the chromosomes move away from the center the cell divides into two daughter cells each containing a haploid number of chromosomes composed of two chromatids after the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells a second round of cell division occurs there meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cells upon fertilization for example when a sperm enters an egg cell two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse the gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half of the set of chromosomes that make up the new offsprings genome meiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis a type of cell division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical daughter cells in all plants and in many protists meiosis results in the formation of spores haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization

345	D494	agreement or concord happens when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relates it is an instance of inflection and usually involves making the value of some grammatical category such as gender or person agree between different words or parts of the sentence for example in standard english one may say i am or he is but not i is or he am this is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its subject agree in person the pronouns i and he are first and third person respectively as are the verb forms am and is the verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subject the agreement based on overt grammatical categories as above is formal agreement in contrast to notional agreement which is based on meaning for instance the phrase the united states is treated as singular for purposes of agreement even though it is formally plural

427	D609	dred scott v sandford also known as the dred scott decision was a landmark decision by the us supreme court it made two main rulings the first ruling was that africanamericans were not citizens and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court the second ruling was that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in any territory acquired subsequent to the creation of the united states given the first ruling most scholars and many contemporary political figures including the leadership of the thennew republican party considered that the second ruling was not binding precedent but mere dictum the rationale of the supreme court regarding the jurisdictional ruling implied that people of african descent both slave and free were not protected by the constitution and were not us citizens since passage of the 14th amendment to the us constitution both rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedent nonetheless the case retains historical significance as it is widely regarded as the worst decision ever made by the supreme court the opinion of the court written by chief justice roger b taney stirred debate the decision was 7–2 and every justice besides taney wrote a separate concurrence or dissent for the first time since marbury v madison the court held an act of congress to be unconstitutional dred scott an africanamerican slave had asked a united states circuit court to award him his freedom because he and his master had resided in a state illinois and a territory wisconsin territory where slavery had been banned chief justice roger taney writing for the court held that scott as a person of african ancestry was not a citizen of the united states and therefore had no right to sue in federal court this holding was contrary to the practice of numerous states at the time particularly free states where free blacks did in fact enjoy the rights of citizens such as the right to vote and hold public office in what is sometimes considered mere obiter dictum the court went on to hold that congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories because slaves are personal property and the fifth amendment to the constitution protects property owners against deprivation of their property without due process of law in reaching this decision taney had hoped to settle the growing controversy surrounding slavery in the united states but it had the opposite effect the decision was fiercely debated across the country as perhaps best exemplified by the lincoln–douglas debates of 1858 abraham lincoln the secondever republican nominee for president was able to win the presidential election in 1860 the stopping of the further expansion of slavery was a key republican party plank the decision played an important role in the timing of state secession and the civil war although it is extreme to say the decision caused the war the decision is acknowledged for the influential role it played in altering the national political landscape it is credited with launching abraham lincoln’s national political career and ultimately allowing for his election although the supreme court has never explicitly overruled the dred scott case the court stated in the slaughterhouse cases that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the fourteenth amendment in 1868 which begins by stating all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside to which the court noted the first observation we have to make on this clause is that it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of differences of opinion it declares that persons may be citizens of the united states without regard to their citizenship of a particular state and it overturns the dred scott decision by making all persons born within the united states and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the united states

608	D860	antoine lavoisier s discovery of the law of conservation of mass led to many new findings in the 19th century joseph proust s law of definite proportions and john dalton s atomic theory branched from the discoveries of antoine lavoisier lavoisiers quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy both of which have mass the mass of the system must remain constant over time as system mass cannot change quantity if it is not added or removed hence the quantity of mass is conserved over time the law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed although it may be rearranged in space or the entities associated with it may be changed in form as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed the law implies requires that during any chemical reaction nuclear reaction or radioactive decay in an isolated system the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the products the concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry mechanics and fluid dynamics historically mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by antoine lavoisier in the late 18th century and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry the closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations even in modern practice in special relativity needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for socalled isolated systems ie those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment in this circumstance the massenergy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation which is the first law of thermodynamics by contrast for a thermodynamically closed system ie one which is closed to exchanges of matter but open to exchanges of nonmaterial energy such as heat and work with the surroundings mass is usually only approximately conserved the input or output of nonmaterial energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory although the change is usually small since relatively large amounts of such energy by comparison with ordinary experience carry only a small amount of mass again by ordinary standards of measurement in special relativity mass is not converted to energy since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into or out of a system however certain types of matter a different concept may be converted to energy so long as the mass of the system is unchanged in the process however if such energy is removed from systems they must lose the mass that is associated with it in general relativity mass and energy conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept subject to different definitions and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in minkowski space for a discussion see mass in general relativity

641	D911	an official game in baseball also sometimes called a regulation game is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary this is approximately the halfway point of the game in the case of inclement weather any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed with the result being final and all records and statistics counted a game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage or is simply canceled and replayed from the start this depends on the rules of each individual league in either case no statistics are counted until the game becomes official since most professional baseball games are nine innings long the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game if the visiting team is leading or the game is tied the end of the fifth inning marks this point if the home team which bats last is already ahead in the score and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning then 41⁄2 innings ie the middle of the fifth is considered an official game the game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth in nearly all cases the official game status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets if a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official fans are entitled to a new ticket for the makeup game or in most cases any other available game of their choice if a game is halted after it becomes official the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given the official game statistic received some attention during the 1995 season when cal ripken jr was approaching the record for consecutive games played previously held by lou gehrig large numbers were hung on the side of the bo warehouse at oriole park at camden yards to show the number of games in ripkens streak each day a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point a similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums including veterans stadium in philadelphia in 2003 busch memorial stadium in st louis in 2005 and the original yankee stadium and shea stadium in new york city in 2008 as each game became official the team would unveil a new lower number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium
642	D912	a telephone number or phone number is a sequence of digits used to call from one telephone line to another in a public switched telephone network when telephone numbers were invented they were short — as few as one two or three digits — and were given orally to a switchboard operator as phone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass the world telephone numbers have become longer in addition to telephones they now access other devices such as computers and fax machines the number contains the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended endpoint for the telephone call each such endpoint must have a unique number within the public switched telephone network most countries use fixed length numbers for normal lines at least and therefore the number of endpoints determines the necessary length of the telephone number it is also possible for each subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often used these shorthand or speed calling numbers are automatically translated to unique telephone numbers before the call can be connected some special services have their own short numbers eg 119 911 000 999 111 and 112 being the emergency services numbers for china japan south korea taiwan and sri lanka canada and the united states australia the united kingdom ireland south africa poland saudi arabia the united arab emirates morocco macao bahrain qatar bangladesh botswana ghana kenya hong kong malaysia mauritius singapore zimbabwe trinidad tobago new zealand kuwait and the european union respectively many systems also allow calls within a local area to be made without dialing the local area code for example a phone number in north america will start with three numbers such as 661 which is the area code followed by seven digits split into sections of three and four such as 5501212 which is the local number some areas now have mandatory tendigit dialing in place even for local calls most telephone networks today exceptions being private intercom and secure phone networks are interconnected in the international telephone network where the format of telephone numbers is standardized by itut in the recommendation e164 this specifies that the entire number should be 15 digits or shorter and begin with a country prefix for most countries this is followed by an area code or city code and the subscriber number which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange itut recommendation e123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print starting with a plus sign and the country code when calling an international number from a fixed line phone the must be replaced with the international call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made from some mobile phones allow the to be entered directly the format and allocation of local phone numbers are controlled by each nations respective government either directly or by sponsored organizations such as nanpa overseen by neustar inc before a telephone call is connected the telephone number must be dialed by the calling party or caller the called party might have equipment that presents caller id before the call is answered

647	D918	alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle and thereby transforms or decays into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less many other types of decays are possible radioactive decay also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting particles of ionizing radiation a material that spontaneously emits this kind of radiation — which includes the emission of energetic alpha particles beta particles and gamma rays — is considered radioactive there are many different types of radioactive decay see table below a decay or loss of energy results when an atom with one type of nucleus called the parent radionuclide transforms to an atom with a nucleus in a different state or to a different nucleus containing different numbers of protons and neutrons either of these products is named the daughter nuclide in some decays the parent and daughter are different chemical elements and thus the decay process results in nuclear transmutation creation of an atom of a new element the first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay beta decay and gamma decay alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle helium nucleus this is the most common process of emitting nucleons but in rarer types of decays nuclei can eject protons or specific nuclei of other elements in the process called cluster decay beta decay occurs when the nucleus emits an electron or positron and a type of neutrino in a process that changes a proton to a neutron or the other way around the nucleus may capture an orbiting electron converting a proton into a neutron electron capture all of these processes result in nuclear transmutation by contrast there exist radioactive decay processes that do not result in transmutation the energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in gamma decay or used to eject an orbital electron by interaction with the excited nucleus in a process called internal conversion radioisotopes occasionally emit neutrons and this results in a change in an element from one isotope to another one type of radioactive decay results in products which are not defined but appear in a range of pieces of the original nucleus this decay is called spontaneous fission this decay happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two and occasionally three smaller daughter nuclei and usually emits gamma rays neutrons or other particles as a consequence radioactive decay is a stochastic ie random process at the level of single atoms in that according to quantum theory it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay however the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time for a large number of atoms the decay rate for the collection is computable from the measured decay constants of the nuclides or equivalently from the halflifes

662	D936	energy transformation in energy systems language energy transformation or energy conversion is the process of changing one form of energy to another in physics the term energy describes the capacity to produce certain changes within a system without regard to limitations in transformation imposed by entropy changes in total energy of systems can only be accomplished by adding or subtracting energy from them as energy is a quantity which is conserved according to the first law of thermodynamics according to special relativity changes in the energy of systems will also coincide with changes in the systems mass and the total amount of mass of a system is a measure of its energy energy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state or a different type of energy energy in many states may be used to do many varieties of physical work energy may be used in natural processes or machines or else to provide some service to society such as heat light or motion for example an internal combustion engine converts the potential chemical energy in gasoline and oxygen into heat which is then transformed into the propulsive energy kinetic energy that moves a vehicle a solar cell converts solar radiation into electrical energy that can then be used to light a bulb or power a computer the generic name for a device which converts energy from one form to another is a transducer in general most types of energy save for thermal energy may be converted efficiently to any other kind of energy sometimes this occurs with an efficiency of essentially 100 such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum or when it orbits nearer or farther from another object in space conversion of other types of energies to heat may also occurs with nearly perfect efficiency many types of friction do this exceptions for perfect conversion efficiency even for isolated systems occur when energy has already been partly distributed among many available quantum states for a collection of particles which are freely allowed to explore any state of momentum and position phase space in such circumstances a measure called entropy or eveningout of energy distribution in such states dictates that future states of the system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution there is no way taking the universe as a whole to collect energy into fewer states once it has spread to them a consequence of this requirement is that there are limitations to the efficiency with which thermal energy can be converted to other kinds of energy since thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal eveningout of energy between all possible states such energy is sometimes considered degraded energy because it is not entirely usable the second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that for this reason thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100 only if the entropy evenness or disorder of the universe is increased by other means to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content otherwise only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy and thus useful work since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature in such a way that the increase in entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy

702	D989	a use tax in united states is complementary to sales tax which means if you buy a taxable productservices without paying any sales tax to vendor you owe use tax you must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item without paying sales tax and store it in your warehouse initially use tax applies to that location where goods were stored later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption this really means that you dont have to pay both sales tax as well as use tax on one transaction it is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable productsservices if vendor doesnt charge any sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess use tax and pay it to the appropriate jurisdication use tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of sales tax but in some states the tax rate is different use tax is also termed as consumption tax or consumer use tax a use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the united states by numerous state governments it is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use storage or consumption in that state not for resale regardless of where the purchase took place if a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state full sales tax is paid at the time of the transaction the use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not subject to his home states sales tax usually this is due to outofstate purchases as well as ordering items through the mail by phone or over the internet from other states the use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed if any had the same goods been purchased in the state of residence for example a resident of massachusetts with a 625 sales and use tax on certain goods and services purchases nonexempt goods or services in new hampshire for use storage or other consumption in massachusetts under new hampshire law the new hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods but the massachusetts purchaseruser must still pay 625 of the sales price directly to the department of revenue in massachusetts as a use tax if the same goods are purchased in a us state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted as a tax credit from the 625 owed for subsequent use storage or consumption in massachusetts with few exceptions no states vendors will charge the native states sales tax on goods shipped out of state meaning all goods ordered from outofstate are essentially free of sales tax the purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods the assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually but some states require a monthly payment for example where a vermont resident has not paid at least 6 sales tax on property brought in for use in the state vermont law requires filing a tax return form su452 and payment by the 20th day of the month following nonexempt purchases to avoid a 50 late fee a 5 penalty per month to a maximum of 25 plus statutory interest on the unpaid tax and penalties typical exemptions include purchases by charitable nonprofit organizations or governmental agencies purchases for resale in commerce and purchases via casual sales by individuals not in the ordinary course of business also note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the us and many have everchanging lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable as an illustration of the complexities a 2006 massachusetts law requires payment of tax on prewritten not custom software purchased and downloaded over the internet for installation and use in massachusetts regardless of where it originates however the actual use of the same software downloaded by a massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a nontaxed service in contrast arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the internet such as downloaded software or music except voip which is specifically defined as taxable telecommunications services software prewritten or custom delivered thru a tangible medium ie on disk in arkansas is taxable even if ordered online except custom software for a particular customer which is nontaxable programming services even if delivered on a disk in most cases this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws but while a brickandmortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictions—up to every us state and locality that assesses them if the company has a presence or nexus in every state as large brickandmortar sellers like walmart and best buy do

737	D1033	in basketball an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by field goal meaning that he or she was assisting in the basket there is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist an assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball however the original definition of an assist did not include such situations so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal unlike in other sports such as ice hockey a pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the nba but does in fiba play only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made point guards tend to get the most assists per game apg as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler centers tend to get fewer assists but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting being inside the key the center often has the best angles and the best position for dishes and other short passes in the scoring area center wilt chamberlain led the nba in assists in 1968 a strong center with insidescoring prowess such as former nba center hakeem olajuwon can also be an effective assistor because the defenses doubleteaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters the nba singlegame assist record is 30 held by scott skiles of the orlando magic against the denver nuggets on december 30 1990 the nba record for most career assists is held by john stockton with 15806

739	D1036	the grecopersian wars also often called the persian wars were a series of conflicts between the achaemenid empire of persia and citystates of the hellenic world that started in 499 bc and lasted until 449 bc the collision between the fractious political world of the greeks and the enormous empire of the persians began when cyrus the great conquered ionia in 547 bc struggling to rule the independentminded cities of ionia the persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them this would prove to be the source of much trouble for the greeks and persians alike in 499 bc the then tyrant of miletus aristagoras embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of naxos with persian support however the expedition was a debacle and preempting his dismissal aristagoras incited all of hellenic asia minor into rebellion against the persians this was the beginning of the ionian revolt which would last until 493 bc progressively drawing more regions of asia minor into the conflict aristagoras secured military support from athens and eretria and in 498 bc these forces helped to capture and burn the persian regional capital of sardis the persian king darius the great vowed to have revenge on athens and eretria for this act the revolt continued with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 bc in 494 bc the persians regrouped and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in miletus at the battle of lade the ionians suffered a decisive defeat and the rebellion collapsed with the final members being stamped out the following year seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland greeks darius embarked on a scheme to conquer greece and to punish athens and eretria for burning sardis the first persian invasion of greece began in 492 bc with the persian general mardonius conquering thrace and macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the campaign in 490 bc a second force was sent to greece this time across the aegean sea under the command of datis and artaphernes this expedition subjugated the cyclades before besieging capturing and razing eretria however while en route to attack athens the persian force was decisively defeated by the athenians at the battle of marathon ending persian efforts for the time being darius then began to plan to complete the conquest of greece but died in 486 bc and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son xerxes i in 480 bc xerxes personally led the second persian invasion of greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled victory over the allied greek states led by sparta and athens at the battle of thermopylae allowed the persians to torch athens and overrun most of greece however while seeking to destroy the combined greek fleet the persians suffered a severe defeat at the battle of salamis the following year the confederated greeks went on the offensive defeating the persian army at the battle of plataea and ending the invasion of greece the allied greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the persian fleet at the battle of mycale before expelling persian garrisons from sestos 479 bc and byzantium 478 bc the actions of the general pausanias at the siege of byzantium alienated many of the greek states from the spartans and the antipersian alliance was therefore reconstituted around athenian leadership as the socalled delian league the delian league continued to campaign against persia for the next three decades beginning with the expulsion of the remaining persian garrisons from europe at the battle of the eurymedon in 466 bc the league won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of ionia however the leagues involvement in an egyptian revolt from 460–454 bc resulted in a disastrous defeat and further campaigning was suspended a fleet was sent to cyprus in 451 bc but achieved little and when it withdrew the grecopersian wars drew to a quiet end some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between athens and persia the socalled peace of callias

research institute sri packet switched networks such as arpanet mark i at npl in the uk cyclades merit network tymnet and telenet were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols the arpanet in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks in 1982 the internet protocol suite tcpip was standardized and consequently the concept of a worldwide network of interconnected tcpip networks called the internet was introduced access to the arpanet was expanded in 1981 when the national science foundation nsf developed the computer science network csnet and again in 1986 when nsfnet provided access to supercomputer sites in the united states from research and

social networking the history of the internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s the public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the internet when a message was sent over the arpanet from computer science professor leonard kleinrocks laboratory at university of california los angeles ucla after the second piece of network equipment was installed at stanford research institute sri packet switched networks such as arpanet mark i at npl in the uk cyclades merit network tymnet and telenet were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols the arpanet in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks in 1982 the internet protocol suite tcpip was standardized and consequently the concept of a worldwide network of interconnected tcpip networks called the internet was introduced access to the arpanet was expanded in 1981 when the national science foundation nsf developed the computer science network csnet and again in 1986 when nsfnet provided access to supercomputer sites in the united states from research and education organizations commercial internet service providers isps began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s the arpanet was decommissioned in 1990 the internet was commercialized in 1995 when nsfnet was decommissioned removing the last restrictions on the use of the internet to carry commercial traffic since the mid1990s the internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture

1780	D2509	on the origin of species published on 24 november 1859 is a work of scientific literature by charles darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology its full title was on the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life for the sixth edition of 1872 the short title was changed to the origin of species darwins book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection it presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research correspondence and experimentation various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology there was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public but during the first half of the 19th century the english scientific establishment was closely tied to the church of england while science was part of natural theology ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique unrelated to other animals the political and theological implications were intensely debated but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream the book was written for nonspecialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication as darwin was an eminent scientist his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific philosophical and religious discussion the debate over the book contributed to the campaign by th huxley and his fellow members of the x club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution with a branching pattern of common descent had occurred but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that darwin thought appropriate during the eclipse of darwinism from the 1880s to the 1930s various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit with the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s darwins concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory now the unifying concept of the life sciences

1998	D33	each antibody binds to a specific antigen an interaction similar to a lock and key an antibody ab also known as an immunoglobulin ig is a large yshaped protein produced by bcells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses the antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen each tip of the y of an antibody contains a paratope a structure analogous to a lock that is specific for one particular epitope similarly analogous to a key on an antigen allowing these two structures to bind together with precision using this binding mechanism an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system or can neutralize its target directly for example by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival the production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell antibodies can occur in two physical forms a soluble form that is secreted from the cell and a membrane bound form that is attached to the surface of a b cell and is referred to as the b cell receptor bcr the bcr is only found on the surface of b cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory b cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the b cells can respond faster upon future exposure in most cases interaction of the b cell with a t helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the b cell and therefore antibody generation following antigen binding soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains there are several different types of antibody heavy chains and several different kinds of antibodies which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals which perform different roles and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures or antigen binding sites to exist this region is known as the hypervariable region each of these variants can bind to a different antigen this enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens the large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites or paratopes followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene which create further diversity antibody genes also reorganize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region this allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system

2234	D1219	heritability asks how much genetics are playing a role in differences in height between people this is not the same as asking how much genetics influences height in any one personthe heritability of a trait within a population is the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals within a population that is due to genetic differences factors including genetics environment and random chance can all contribute to the variation between individuals in their observable characteristics in their phenotypes heritability thus analyzes the relative contributions of differences in genetic and nongenetic factors to the total phenotypic variance in a population for instance some humans in a population are taller than others heritability attempts to identify how much genetics are playing a role in part of the population being extra tall heritability is measured by estimating the relative contributions of genetic and nongenetic differences to the total phenotypic variation in a population heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics particularly in selective breeding and behaviour genetics for instance twin studies but is less widely used in population genetics heritability measures the fraction of phenotype variability that can be attributed to genetic variation this is not the same as saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics in addition heritability can change without any genetic change occurring eg when the environment starts contributing to more variation a case in point consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence heritability could increase if genetic variation increases causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation eg to show different levels of intelligence on the other hand heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation eg to show more similar levels of intelligence heritability is increasing because genetics are contributing more variation or because nongenetic factors are contributing less variation what matters is the relative contribution here we see why heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment the extent of dependence of phenotype on environment can also be a function of the genes involved matters of heritability are complicated because genes may canalize a phenotype making its expression almost inevitable in all occurring environments individuals with the same genotype can also exhibit different phenotypes through a mechanism called phenotypic plasticity which makes heritability difficult to measure in some cases recent insights in molecular biology have identified changes in transcriptional activity of individual genes associated with environmental changes however there are a large number of genes whose transcription is not affected by the environment
